# Fully-Direct-Transcription-2025
This repository contains MATLAB codes related to the numerical results section of my article titled:
''A fully direct transcription method for solving distributed-order time-fractional diffusion optimal control problems with box constraints''.
In this search, we transformed the distributed-order time-fractional diffusion optimal control problems into a convex quadratic ptimization problem
using the operational matrices introduced in the study. We then solved the resulting problem using the quadprog command in MATLAB to achieve the desired outcomes.
